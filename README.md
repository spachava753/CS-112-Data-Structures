# CS-112-Data-Structures
## Data Structures projects

This repository is filled with my old data structures projects from 
the Rutgers University class CS 112. 

### Polynomial Project:
  #### Polynomial.java: Authors - Rutgers University NB-CS112, Sai Nayan R Malladi
    (Methods edited by SRM)
    Implements addition, multiplication, and evaluation of polynomials
  #### Structures and Driver: Author - RU NB CS112
  #### Node.java
    Implements linked list node that implements the term instances
  #### Term.java
    Implements a term of a polynomial
  #### Polytest.java
    Contains the main method
   
### Minimum Spanning Tree
  #### Structures: Author - RU NB CS112
  #### Vertex.java
    Represents the vertext of a graph, also contains parent reference
  #### Graph.java
    Using Vertex.java, represents a graph constructed from information given in text files
  #### MinHeap.java
    Minimum Heap for use in MST.java
  #### PartialTree.java
    Helper class
  #### MST: Authors - RU NB CS112, Sai Nayan R Malladi(Methods filled by)
  #### MST.java
    Builds single vertex partial trees to initialize the algorithm
  #### PartialTreeList.java
    Adds and removes partial trees according to the algorithm
